# TravelExpenses

⦁	Write a TravelExpenses class that prompts the user in a JFrame using grid layout for the following inputs (all doubles, except the first):
⦁	Number of days on the trip
⦁	Amount of airfare (if any)
⦁	Amount of car rental charges (if any)
⦁	Number of miles driven in personal car (if any)
⦁	Amount of parking fees (if any)
⦁	Amount of taxi charges (if any)
⦁	Amount of tolls (if any)
⦁	Conference or seminar fees (if any)
⦁	Meal charges
⦁	Lodging charges
The company reimburses all travel expenses subject to the following maximums (a-d are restrictions on the maximum the company will reimburse the employee):
⦁	$37 per day for meals
⦁	Up to $10 per day parking fees
⦁	Up to $20 per day taxi charges
⦁	Up to $95 per day for lodging
⦁	If a personal vehicle is used, $0.27 per mile driven
If an employee goes over in a category, then the employee is responsible for paying the excess out-of-pocket. Being under in another category does NOT offset the excess.
The application should calculate and display:
⦁	Total expenses incurred,
⦁	The allowable expenses for the trip,
⦁	The excess that must be paid by the traveler, if any.
